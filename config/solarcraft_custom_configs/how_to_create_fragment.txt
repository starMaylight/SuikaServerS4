How to create a fragment. (This thing is experimental and may contain bugs)
Fragments json IS NOT RELOADABLE!
Restart mc or server to apply changes.
Also if you removed or added a fragment delete your solar lexicon and make new (or tell player to do it).
First of all start by
(// - those are comments, don't write them in json file)
{
    "type": "" //a type field declares what type of fragment you are creating. (Possible values: "information","item","items")
}
Information type format:
{
    "type": "information",
    "translation_id": "",               //translation id that needs to be translated in lang files. Defines the name of the fragment. (String)
    "unique_id": "",                    //unique id is the unique identifier of the fragment(ah yes logic). Should be different than all other fragments. (String)
    "category_base": "",                //defines the category in solar lexicon where that fragment will be located. (Possible values: scroll down)
    "sub_category_base": "",            //defines the subcategory in category where that fragment will be located. (Possible values: scroll down)
    "progression_stage": "",            //defines what progression stage is needed to be completed to unlock this fragment. (Possible values: scroll down)

    "icon": {
      "item": ""                        //item to be used as an icon (String that should match any of existing item in the game)
    },
    "priority": 1                       //priority to unlock this fragment (for example if there are a fragment with priority 1 and 2, the 1 will be opened first) (Integer)

      {"item": "", "recipe_id": "" },   //item is an item name (for ex: minecraft:diamond), recipe_id is a recipe to show inside the fragment(SHOULD MATCH THE RECIPE TYPE!).
      {"item": "", "recipe_id": "" },
      {"item": "", "recipe_id": "" }
    ],
    "priority": 1                       //Priority to unlock this fragment (for example if there are a fragment with priority 1 and 2, the 1 will be opened first) (Integer)
